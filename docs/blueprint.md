# **App Name**: TestGenius

## Core Features:

- Automated Test Generation: Automatically scan product pages (provided as URLs) and generate Playwright tests using Gemini AI, focusing on key functionalities.
- Intelligent Test Prioritization: Prioritize a subset of valuable end-to-end tests (50-60) using AI analysis of code changes and user behavior simulations, effectively narrowing down the testing scope.
- AI-Powered Issue Detection: Integrate Gemini AI to analyze test results, detect issues, and propose fixes by examining error messages and code context; AI acts as a tool for issue detection and resolution suggestions.
- Test Management UI: Display generated tests, prioritization results, and AI-driven issue detection in a clean, structured UI. Each test should show its priority score and related issues.
- Configuration Management: Provide a configuration interface to adjust AI parameters (e.g., test generation aggressiveness, issue detection sensitivity) and manage project URLs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White or light grey for a clean, professional look.
- Secondary color: Dark grey or black for text and primary UI elements.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) to highlight important actions and AI-driven insights.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for code snippets, test results, and UI elements.
- Use clear, functional icons to represent test status, AI suggestions, and configuration options.
- Structured layout with clear separation of test generation, prioritization, and issue detection sections.

## Original User Request:

PROJECT SCOPE SUMMARY
The client — a German-based FinTech platform focused on streamlining tax,
accounting, and payroll for SMEs — is urgently seeking a senior-level, highly
autonomous team to co-develop an AI-driven test automation system.
OBJECTIVE
Develop a "Test Automation, Automation" framework — an advanced QA tool
that automates the creation, refinement, and maintenance of tests at scale,
built on top of an existing Playwright-based test foundation.
TECHNICAL RESPONSIBILITIES
● Expand the existing Playwright framework into a complete, intelligent
automation system.
● Build a solution that can:
○ Automatically scan product pages and generate thousands of
tests.
○ Select and prioritize a small, valuable set of E2E tests (50–60
tests).
○ Integrate LLMs (Large Language Models) to:
■ Detect issues
■ Propose fixes
■ Learn and evolve with product development
● Prototype quickly without relying on detailed specs or project
managers.
● Operate with high speed, autonomy, and output focus.
TEAM COMPOSITION
● 1–2 Senior Engineers with:
○ Strong experience in Playwright or similar test automation tools
○ Proven track record building automated test frameworks
○ Familiarity with AI/LLM integration and QA systems
○ Ability to work independently and self-onboard using Notion, the
existing codebase, and internal chatbot tools
● Optional: Solution Architect or CTO-level support for high-level
guidance and strategic input
KEY REQUIREMENTS
● Experience with test automation tools and frameworks (especially
Playwright)
● Understanding of AI/LLM-driven QA practices
● Ability to deliver prototypes quickly and iterate based on feedback
ENGAGEMENT STYLE
● Sprint-based collaboration (not long-term retainers)
● High-intensity, focused development with rapid offboarding
post-delivery
● Fully remote with preferred timezone overlap, but priority given to
quality and speed
